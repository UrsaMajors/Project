        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Limbus Company is turn based role playing game where the player has to control a cast of unqiue characters into bizzare scenarios.
            The combat is balanced around players geting unique varitions of the main cast that give them different skills
        </p>

        <h3>Combat System Explantion</h3>

        <p>
            There are two types of fight in Limbus Company one is autobased and the other is controled. In the Autobased type combat the player has far less control over
            the action characters take and are uanble to choose what skills to use but targeting of the skills. A controlled battle however is able where the player not only
            chooses what skills to use but also targeting of the skills
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            On top of skill charcters naturall have thier is one other major mechanic called sin resonace when a charcter uses a skill they collect a point of sin based on
            skill type which can procc additonal passive effects of the charcters or a speical large attack called ego character can one type of ego for each tier. It goes in the
            the following order zayin,teth,he, waw, and aleph. As of the making of this aleph currently has no current aviable options but typicall the higher in the order list the
            more powerful the ego are but using them comes with a cost of sin points and sanity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Sanity as a mechanic impacts how effectilty yours skill will be skills use a coin based system to determine how succeful the skill is in a combat clash. Character skill can either have a postive
            or negative bonus. If the characters has postive bonus on skills then you have higher sanity will grant higher odds for getting odds proc postive bonus. The oppsite applies for negative bonus
            where the desired effect is to have worse sanity to prevent the bonus to proc from lowering your base skill value.
