        <h2>What is Refraction Railway?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            Refraction Railway is a seasonol event in Limbus Company where players go through a series of diffcult fights in a row. Each season of the Railway has while all sharing a common factor of being a "Boss Rush" all them have mechanics
            that make them all unquie from previous entires of Railways however.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2> How will I be rating each of the Railways?</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Diffculty</h3>
        <p>For Diffcult of the Railways the avaiable of cast of charcters will be taking in account and will be based on day one of the railway so if Ids were released after the start of a railway will not be considered</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
        <p>For Mechanics I will discuss overall the mechanial challenge each bosses offers in thier own fights So I will being an overall average of mehcnial challenge and not based on indivual fights due to outliers.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>New Content</h3>
        <p>Lastly I will be talking about the design of bossess added in the railway and not pre-existing design overall and be giving a rating to the new fights added for railway</p>
        <h3>More Details</h3>
        <p>For me to go greater in depth in what each railway review is looking at the pdf provided.</p>
