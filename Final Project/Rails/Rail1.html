        <h1>Refraction Railway 1</h1>
        <br />
       <h2>Difficulty:4/10</h2>
        <p>As this is the first ever railway releasd and the game was far younger making thier to be less charcter varation and many characters being not very good it led to the highest Dps charcters in the game all being grouped togther
        to burst down all the bosses for the fastest turn count and causes this stratgy worked for all fights it made fights for fast and simple with only a few expections to this where the diffcult spiked but still is was very easy
        for most players</p>
       <h2>Mechanics: 5/10</h2>
        <p>As the game was new and player skill was not very good at the time the mechanics for all the fights were kept simple with the expection of the final fight where it has complete unquie winconditon to the fight where instead of just
        bursting the main enemies down it focused on killing its minion by either bursting them down in single high damge turns or using the unquie karma effects this boss inflicts to cause the boss to kills it own minions to defenses to lower once all were killed.
        Overall however for most other fights thier mechanices could be ignored or were reusesd from main story content so players aleardy knew how to counter them</p>
        <h3>New Content 4/10</h3>
        <p>As stated in both points above the game was still an early state for most new content was not very intresting  in comparison to more modern additions leaving th new content in generel desptie being introducted in a diffcult gamemode
        all the new content has been used as mostly dailies and weekly fights</p>
        <h3>Overall:5/10</h3>
        <p>As the first Railway it isn't very expectional in aspect but also not bad and offers no true special mechianic that applies to it alone making it the most basic and average of all the Railways currenlty made.</p>
