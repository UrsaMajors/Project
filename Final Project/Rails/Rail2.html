        <h1>Refraction Railway 2</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>Difficulty:7/10</h2>
        <p>Due to the sheer length of railway having over 20 total fights. With every fight getting harder and harder. It leads to constant ramping of stacks and as you progress you gain buffs and so the bosses</p>
        <h2>Mechanics: 9/10</h2>
        <p>This Railway adds in several brand new unquie mechanics to the many of the fights which all require creating unquie stragtegys fights. It also leads to all fights that aren't reapeated to feel unquie to each other. The final fight in 
        parrticales makes so you have to pass attention to sin mechanic far more than in normal fights. This all leads to have a very mechanic heavy and intresting fights overall</p>
        <h2>New Content 9/10</h2>
        <p>Many of the New fights are incredibly unquie and remeberly thank to each have thier own unquie antimations that only apply for them that many fights.</p>
        <h3>Overall:8.5/10</h3>
        <p>Despite the issue of length cause it can be considered far to overlong with having over 20 fights the diffcult for fights were challgeing and were mostly all mechanicly intresting and the new content added with the railway was very 
            remorable leading to an overall fantastic experince overall</p>
